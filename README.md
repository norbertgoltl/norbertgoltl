# Hello World ðŸ‘‹

Front-end Developer with GenAI/LLM Expertise | Working Primarily Remote

Hi, I'm Norbert â€“ a Front-end Developer from Budapest, Hungary, expanding into Full Stack development with extensive expertise in LLM technology integration. In recent years, I've increasingly focused on developing solutions that leverage large language models to create business value, including response generation, vector database management, and content retrieval. I'm currently working on an intelligent assistant application that helps users obtain relevant information and recommendations through natural language interaction, using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) technology that operates with semantic search and context-based analysis on custom data sources (documents, product data, knowledge bases, etc.). Always eager to learn and embrace new challenges! ðŸš€
